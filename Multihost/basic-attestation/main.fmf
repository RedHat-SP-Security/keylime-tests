summary: Tests basic keylime attestation scenario on multiple hosts
description: |
 Running services on different systems - verifier, registrar, agent1+tenant, agent2.
 Uses custom build certificates.
 Starts verifier, registrar, agent, agent2.
 Registers both agent2 providing a payload with autorun.sh and python revocation script.
 Verifiers that systems passed attestation and autorun.sh has been executed.
 Does changes on a system with agent1 and verifies that system has failed attestation.
 Confirms that the revocation script has been executed only on both agents unless revocation is disabled through the KEYLIME_TEST_DISABLE_REVOCATION environment variable.
