summary: CVE-2023-3674 - attestation failure when the quote signature does not validate
description: |
    Testing using the durable/offline attestation because it is easier
    then to build a malformed keylime agent.
    Running all services on localhost.
    Configure durable attestation and register the agent.
    Stop all services and perform verification of durable attestation data.
    Extract a single quote from durable attestation data and modify quote signature.
    Confirm that durable attestation fails and the signature verification error
    is not silenced.
