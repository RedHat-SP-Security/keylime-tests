    Uses certificates generated by keylime.
    Starts verifier, registrar.
    Opens a connection to the registrar requesting registration of a fake agent.
    Responds to the challenge protocol with a message containing incorrect auth
    tag during the activation phase.
    Checks that the registrar does not sends the expected auth tag back.
