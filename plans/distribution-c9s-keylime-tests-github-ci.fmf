summary: Run tests from the rhel-9-main branch on the distribution keylime

# unfortunately, filtering using adjust doesn't work for plan for context defined
# in the very same plan. We need to update packit.yaml
context:
  swtpm: yes
  agent: rust
  faked_measured_boot_log: no

adjust:
 - when: target_PR_branch is defined and target_PR_branch != rhel-9-main
   enabled: false
   because: we want to run this plan only for PRs targeting the main branch
