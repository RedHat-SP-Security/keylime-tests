summary: Tests adding an agent that has an EK certificate considered malformed 
    by python-cryptography
description: |
    swtpm will provide a properly signed (by the swtpm-local) EK certificate that
    happens to be considered malformed by python-cryptoghraphy, due to its stricter
    ASN.1 parsing since version 35; OpenSSL considers this certificate valid.
    Confirms that we are still able to add such an agent that has an EK certificate
    with these characteristics, by using an external program to perofrm the signature
    chain verification on the EK certificate (since python-cryptography will refuse to
    do so).
    Running all services on localhost.

adjust:
  - when: swtpm is not defined or swtpm == no
    enabled: false
    because: This tests needs SWTPM emulator
  - when: arch == ppc64le
    enabled: false
    because: We do not have tools for creating malformed EK built for ppc64le
