summary: Tests keylime attestation with mTLS disabled for agent
description: |
    Configures the keylime agent to run without mTLS, and tests restrictions
    related with 'mtls_cert_enabled', 'enable_insecure_payload', and
    'payload_script' options.
    First, test that when mTLS is disabled via 'mtls_cert_enabled=False', the agent
    will not start when 'payload_script' is not empty and 'enable_insecure_payload'
    is 'False'.
    Then, test that setting 'payload_script' to be empty allows the agent to run.
    Finally, test that 'enable_insecure_payload' must be 'True' for the agent to
    execute the payload script while mTLS is disabled.
    In the end it is tested that failing the attestation by running a script not
    listed in the allowlist still triggers the revocation scripts to be executed.
    All services (verifier, registrar, and agent) are executed on localhost.
