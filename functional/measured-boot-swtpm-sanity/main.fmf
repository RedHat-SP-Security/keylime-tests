summary: Sanity test of measured boot policy using swtpm
description: |
    Running all services on localhost.
    Requires SWTPM emulator
    Starts verifier, registrar, agent.
    Uses accept-all measured boot policy for the verifier.
    Registers agent providing empty policy in --mb_refstate, confirms successful verification.
    Configure python agent to read custom bios_binary_measurements from /var/tmp.
    Re-registers agent providing --mb_refstate generated using create_mb_refstate.
    Confirms that agent fails verification since PCR banks won't match.
    Fix the PCR banks by extending with events from measured boot log.
    Generate measured boot policies with create_mb_refstate and keylime-policy.
    For each policy, re-register and re-enroll agents confirming successful verification.
    Test commands related with the named measured boot policies.
