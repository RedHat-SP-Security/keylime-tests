summary: Sanity test of measured boot policy using swtpm
description: |
 Running all services on localhost.
 Requires SWTPM emulator
 Starts verifier, registrar, agent.
 Uses accept-all measured boot policy for the verifier.
 Registers agent providing empty policy in --mb_refstate, confirms successful verification.
 Configure python agent to read custom bios_binary_measurements from /var/tmp.
 Re-registers agent providing --mb_refstate generated using create_mb_refstate.
 Confirms that agent fails verification since PCR banks won't match.

  - when: swtpm is not defined or swtpm != yes
    enabled: false
    because: This tests works only with SWTPM emulator
  - when: arch == s390x
    enabled: false
    because: Measured boot not functioning on s390x
  - when: distro == rhel-8 or distro = centos-stream-8
    enabled: false
    because: RHEL-8 has old tpm2-tools
  - when: agent == rust and faked_measured_boot_log is not defined
    enabled: false
    because: For Rust agent we are not able to fake measuredboot log during runtime
