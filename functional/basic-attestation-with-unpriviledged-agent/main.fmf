summary: Tests keylime attestation with agent runnig as unpriviledged user
description: |
 Configures keylime agent to run as unprivileged user using /usr/lib/keylime-agent as its $KEYLIME_DIR.
 Executes basic agent attestation and revocation scenario to confirm it works.
 With services running as keylime user this test may seem unnecessary but at least we can verify that agent can be separated from other keylime services.
