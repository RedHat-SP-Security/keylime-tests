summary: Test that one agent cannot send attestations on behalf of another agent
description: |
    Running all services on localhost in push mode with authentication.

    Threat model:
    - Agent B (attacker) has its own valid Bearer token
    - Agent B attempts to submit attestation for Agent A (victim) using its own token
    - The verifier MUST reject because Token B belongs to Agent B, not Agent A

    Test scenario:
    1. Start Agent A, enroll it in verifier
    2. Stop Agent A, restart TPM (creates new TPM identity)
    3. Start Agent B with different UUID, authenticate, get Token B
    4. Use Token B to attempt attestation for Agent A
    5. Verify the request is rejected with 401/403

    This tests the authorization boundary ensuring tokens are bound to
    the agent_id and cannot be used for cross-agent attestation attacks.
